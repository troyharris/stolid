<body><h1>Things That Irk Me in Software Engineer Job Postings</h1>

<p>I&rsquo;m not currently looking for a new job, but I do run across many postings through recruiters and on various blogs and aggregators such as Hacker News. Here are things that would turn me off from wanting to apply.</p>

<h2>Use of the Word &ldquo;Hacker&rdquo;</h2>

<p>I hate that word. It implies you&rsquo;re looking for a kid and not an adult who wants a serious career in software development. It&rsquo;s a desperate way of saying, &ldquo;Hey look, we&rsquo;re hip!&rdquo; While you&rsquo;re at it, search for &ldquo;geek&rdquo; and &ldquo;nerd&rdquo; and replace those as well.</p>

<h2>Familiar/Cute Talk</h2>

<p>Don&rsquo;t tell a cute story or make jokes or try to be amusing. When someone applies for a job they are making a huge, life-changing decision. They don&rsquo;t want a clever essay about the founder&rsquo;s life philosophy or random facts about polar bears. Explain the job and the requirements. When you write something that looks like a bad Lena Dunham blog post, you&rsquo;re giving the impression that your company doesn&rsquo;t take itself seriously. </p>

<h2>Casual Workplace Bragging</h2>

<p>It appears we are in an arms race for the most casual office. &ldquo;Come to work in your pajamas!&rdquo; &ldquo;Bring your dog!&rdquo; &ldquo;Drink free beer!&rdquo; </p>

<p>Hey, I like good perks and a casual environment as much as the next person. I love wearing t-shirts to work. Things have gone too far, though. I&rsquo;d rather hear about how you&rsquo;re going to provide me a comfortable workspace and the equipment and software I need to do my job. I want to hear about how supportive management is. I want to hear you brag about your efficient project management procedures. </p>

<p>Things you can talk about are other perks like public transportation passes, free lunches, vacation days, etc. </p>

<p>These three things are basically summed up as: act professional. I don&rsquo;t know of any of my friends who would consider staking their professional life on a company who appears to not take itself or its employees seriously. In the reverse, ask yourself this: Do you really want to hire an employee who calls themselves a hacker geek, gets excited about pajama time, drinks on the job and spends half the day playing with the office dogs?</p>
